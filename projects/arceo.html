	<h1>Mexican "Nobel Peace Prize"<br />
	  Fundación Sergio Méndez Arceo<br />
	  Mexico</h1>
	<p>This Mexican foundation supports the annual bestowal of a Human Rights Award for an individual or group that is on the forefront of working for human rights in Mexico. 
	By receiving this award, the person or organization is given publicity and support for the work in which they are engaged. In some cases where the individual is facing 
	persecution for having stood up for human rights in the face of powerful forces, being honored with this prize also provides some protection because their work and the 
	cause they are supporting becomes more well known and has received national recognition.
</p>
<h3>CURRENT ACTIVITIES</h3>
In 2008 and 2009 the Fundación Segio Méndez Arceo has also been working to prevent that a large canyon near the city of Cuernavaca be officially used as a landfill for the 
city's trash. This has been a recreation area for local people, and the stream running through the canyon is used by homes and communities downstream. It is also an area of abundant 
wildlife, including an endangered species of frogs. Many archaeological pieces can be found in the canyon although it has never been well studied.
