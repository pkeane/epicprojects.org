	<h1>Sustainable Agriculture Program <br />
	  FUNDAMARCOS-Baja Verapaz<br />
	  Guatemala</h1>
	  
	
	 <h2>How does FUNDAMARCOS promote successful, sustainable agriculture?</h2>
	 
	 <p>The FUNDAMARCOS Agricultural Program begins work with farm families by 
	  focusing on increasing yields of basic food crops, which in Guatemala are 
	  corn and beans.  By implementing extremely effective new practices of water 
	  management, soil conservation and sustainable agriculture, program participants 
	  usually double their corn and beans harvests in the first year. This is primarily 
	  the result of water management and the enhanced water holding capacity of the soil with organic 
	  fertilization. By the third year the soil has been built up and harvests regularly triple. 
	  At the same time, the use of expensive purchased agricultural inputs is greatly reduced 
	  with switching to organic farming. These new farming practices demand rigorous labor, but 
	  if the cultivatable area of the family farm is only 2 to 5 acres, very intensive farming is 
	  essential.
	  <p>Once families have a secure food supply, they can make choices that will enhance quality 
	  of life and family income. Many farmers who have been participating in the FUNDAMARCOS program 
	  are now able to produce their family's food and also grow a small cash crop. This success has 
	  encouraged an outburst of diverse new activities by these program participants.</p>
	  <p>Farmers throughout the program area are starting to plant cash crops of vegetables, fruit trees, 
	  and coffee. Sometimes this is done on a very small piece land. This 
	  <a href="../images/projects/fundamarcos/fundamarcosAg02.jpg" rel="lightbox[fundamarcos]">photo</a> shows how radishes 
	  are being grown in several small, carefully prepared beds made in a rocky hillside This has also 
	  been done with onions, garlic, and cilantro. One enterprising farmer is growing cilantro in a great 
	  number of small beds, similar to one in the photo, which he has developed on his own rocky hillside. 
	  Each week his wife is able to harvest the cilantro of one bed to sell in the local market and obtain
	  a regular, small amount of cash income.</p>
