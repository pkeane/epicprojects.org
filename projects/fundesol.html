	<h1>Adult Education <br />
	  FUNDESOL<br />
	  Honduras</h1>
	
	<p>FUNDESOL, La Fundación Para el Desarrollo Sostenible Lenca, is a Honduras non-profit dedicated to the promotion of social progress in the 
	Lenca communities of the region of San Francisco, Opalaca, Honduras. The goals of FUNDESOL include promoting sustainable agriculture, 
	education, leadership development, and the building of local indigenous institutions. A current project is the construction of facilities 
	for a Vocational Agriculture Training Center in the Lenca community of Monteverde.</p>
	<p>The first phase of the construction of the Vocational Agriculture Training Center was facilitated by a multidisciplinary team of 
	25 persons from North Carolina who traveled to Monteverde, Opalaca, in March of 2009. They contributed labor and expertise in the 
	construction of the first building which was completed by local builders later in the year.<p> 
	<p>A strategic plan for the formation of leaders in sustainable agriculture and natural resource conservation is now in place under the direction 
of La Semilla del Progreso, Siguatepeque, Honduras. In January of 2010, Lenca communities of San Francisco, Opalaca, selected representatives 
to participate in a year-long training program directed by La Semilla del Progreso. These leaders will participate in 6 courses of 5 days each 
for a total of 30 days of training in residence. In addition, the five Lenca participants will receive 3 on-farm supervision visits to review 
the application of the practices they have learned during their training. As a requisite for participation in this year-long training program, 
these trainees have committed to working during the year with 5 additional farm families in each of their areas. Thus, a total of 30 families 
will be taught and supervised in the application of the practices of sustainable farming.</p>
