	<h1>Agricultural Training Center<br />
	  La Semilla del Progreso<br />
	  Honduras</h1>  	 

	<h3>Youth Groups:</h3>

<p>La Semilla del Progreso is presently providing agricultural vocational education for groups of 
youth in four villages. Through a 2-year structured program of instruction, La Semilla is giving teens 
from farming backgrounds new hope and the necessary skills to someday support their 
own families in rural Honduras. These youth of 14 to 22 years old are responding with enthusiasm, embracing 
the idea of developing their own agricultural projects. Having their own projects, they are putting in many 
hours of labor and are beginning to obtain the kind of harvests that will encourage them to continue and to 
take on new projects. The agricultural training and inspiration provided by La Semilla has been able to restore 
the term "farmer" as a viable vocational option for these teenagers. Success is also due to the fact that parents, 
grandparents, and often siblings are actively involved in the program. For example, it is the parents, or sometimes 
grandparents, who provide these young people with parcels of land to put into practice their newly learned farming knowledge.</p>
<h4>TRAINING SCHEDULE<h4>
<p>During the first year of training, the youth receive two 4-day residential courses at the La Semilla 
Training Center, with follow-up classes in the local community and individual visits to the project of each 
student by Laureano Jacobo or other staff of  La Semilla. Each youth group is also guided by a part-time junior leader. 
This is a former student who has demonstrated enthusiasm and has had excellent agricultural projects. In the second year, 
the staff of La Semilla conducts all the classes and group meetings in the village. They also regularly visit all of the 
students individual projects to give encouragement and instruction.  </p>
<p>Since the program with youth begun in 2001, La Semilla del Progreso has mentored approximately 4 groups a year, 
working with each group 2 to 3 years. When one group graduates, La Semilla begins a new group in a new area. In addition 
to the students participating in each year's program, La Semilla keeps in contact with many past students and occasionally 
provides them special addition courses or learning opportunities.</p>
