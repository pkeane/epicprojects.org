	<h1>Agricultural and Vocational Training Center<br />
	  Loma Linda Training Center<br />
	  Honduras</h1>
	 
	  	 <p>Loma Linda began in 1972 as a center for training farmers in the techniques of sustainable agriculture. It also was the small, 
	  	 steep sided valley where José Elías Sánchez experimented with organic farming, terracing, erosion control, and the specific growth 
	  	 requirements of many different food crops. As an extremely gifted teacher, Elías taught all that he was learning to the many groups 
	  	 and individuals who arrived at Loma Linda. By 1998 Elías had given instruction to approximately 40,000 persons at Loma Linda.</p>
	  	 <p>In 1998 the Loma Linda Training Center was washed away by the tremendous flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch. Then, just before 
	  	 the newly rebuild center was inaugurated in 2000, José Elías died. However, through the tireless work of Cándida Osorio, Elías 
	  	 Sánchez's widow and co-worker, plus the assistance of the many friends of Loma Linda, the complicated legal issues related to the 
	  	 rebirth of the Loma Linda Training Center were overcome. Loma Linda has now joined with 17 other farmer-owned training centers in 
	  	 a network of centers teaching sustainable agriculture. This is most appropriate since Loma Linda was the first farmer-to-farmer 
	  	 training center in Honduras and has provided a model for the other centers in the network. The dream of José Elías Sánchez is being 
	  	 fulfilled - to establish centers where one Honduran farmer teaches another to improve crop yields while using environmentally sound 
	  	 farming methods.</p>
