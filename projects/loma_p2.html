	<h1>Agricultural and Vocational Training Center<br />
	  Loma Linda Training Center<br />
	  Honduras</h1>
	 
	  	<h3>History of Loma Linda and José Elías Sánchez:</h3>

 <p>The Loma Linda Training Center is the legacy of a lifetime of effort by José Elías Sánchez. The center was started in 1972.  In 1998 the 
 Loma Linda Training Center was washed away by the tremendous flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch. It destroyed Elías Sanchez's office and 
 personal library. The training center where Elías had given courses to 40,000 persons since 1972 was washed away when water, mud, rocks, and 
 trees roared down the canyon where it stood.</p>
<p>Only the terraces of the sustainable agriculture demonstration area remained as testament to his effective soil and water management 
practices. A new cement block center now stands on higher ground above the stream. The Canadian International Development Organization 
provided a grant for materials to build a large classroom/dinning room, a conference sized kitchen, two large dormitories, and bathroom 
facilities. Teams of Honduran volunteers put in innumerable construction hours of labor. EPIC and the Dunamis Peace Institute together gave 
funds to purchase furniture, equip the kitchen, and buy educational supplies including a TV, VCR and videos.</p>
<p>To the great sadness of all who knew him, on the Saturday before the rebuilt Loma Linda Training Center was to have been inaugurated, 
Elías died very suddenly (18 March, 2000). He most likely had streptococcal pneumonia and before treatment could take effect, he passed away. 
On May 18, 2000, a beautiful celebration of Elías life took place on the patio of the new Loma Linda Center. Representatives of two Central 
American universities, numerous national and international NGO representatives, representatives from Honduran government agencies, including 
the Ministry of Natural Resources in which Elías served, joined campesinos and the family in commemorating the important contributions that 
Elías had made to the world. Elías was a most talented teacher and an effective proponent of sustainable agriculture, soil and water 
conservation, and living harmoniously with the environment. He also believed deeply in the abilities and intelligence of the Honduran 
farmers who he inspired to take action. He pioneered the concept of cultivating first the "Human Farm", so that motivated and aware humans 
would care for the earth.</p>
<p>Elías Sánchez's widow and co-worker, Cándida Osorio, and the many friends of Loma Linda continue the work initiated by Elías. 
On July 22, 2000, a group of friends and former colleagues of Elías signed a document legally forming "Amigos de Loma Linda". EPIC became 
one of the "amigos" with Paul McKay as chair. Their goal was to see that Loma Linda continued as an educational training center that would 
further Elías' life long work of promoting sustainable agriculture, vocational training, soil and water conservation, and environmentally 
sound land management.  With the tireless work of all these parties, the complicated legal issues related were overcome and the rebirth of 
the Loma Linda Training Center was begun.</p>
