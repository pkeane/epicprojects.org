<h3>Oral History Project</h3>

 <p> One current activity of La Casa Para La Cultura Maya is an oral history project coordinated with San Carlos
 University and implemented by university students. For two years, a group of students has been video taping 
 interviews with older Mayan men and women as a vehicle of documentation of the values and customs the elderly 
 remember. In a time of very rapid cultural change in Mayan communities, these interviews represent the 
 beginning of an oral history library which Casa founders feel is an important part of promoting the continuation 
 of Mayan culture. EPIC has provided a HD/DVD video camera, tripod and cassette tapes. The students are donating
 their time and paying their expenses for the project. On November 19, 2010 an event was held at La Casa Para 
 La Cultura Maya to present the 2010 oral history project, called Una Llamada a la Historia.</p>	 

<h3>History of the Casa de la Cultura Maya</h3>

 <p> Kauffman Museum, a regional ethnographic and environmental museum in Kansas has
been asked to share its creativity and technical resources with FUNDAMARCOS in
the planning of the cultural center and the design of its exhibits. Kauffman
Museum was chosen to give this assistance because of the staff's experience in
cultural interpretation, including interpretation of Maya culture gained
through the museum's special exhibition and educational project entitled
"Threads of Life: Maya Clothing from Guatemala". This exhibition received a
1993 Award of Excellence from the Kansas Museum Association. Kauffman Museum
also has extensive experience providing excellent educational experiences for
children and youth, including school field trips, age-appropriate interactive
children's exhibits, and summer camps for children of all ages.
Chuck Regier, Curator of Exhibits at the Kauffman Museum is serving as a
facilities and exhibit design consultant. He has made two trips to Guatemala,
spending several weeks doing on-site consultations and planning.
<br>
In 2008 EPIC helped with the construction of an additional bathroom. This new women's bathroom will help 
facilitate hosting larger groups.</p>

<h3>Continued improvements in the facilities of La Casa</h3>

 <p> La Casa Para La Cultura Maya now has a roofed stage area with a raised brick tile floor. It is quite 
 attractive and will greatly facilitate presentations at La Casa. The roof will also protect speakers from 
 too much sun or inclement weather. Another improvement accomplished during the spring of 2010 was the 
 construction of a hand-dug 50 foot deep dry well. The well is necessary to hold rain runoff from the 
 2,500 sq. ft. patio and roofs of adjacent buildings. The alternative was connecting the patio's drains to the 
 city of Antigua's sewer system, which could have resulted in sewer water backing up into the patio when 
 there were heavy rains.</p>
