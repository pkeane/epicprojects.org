	<h1>Violence Reduction<br />
	 Toys and Tee Shirts for Peace<br />
	  VENEZUELA</h1>
	  <p>The Christian Community "Manantial de Vida" (Spring of Life) is a radical church, several members of whom were formerly 
	  addicts and delinquents.  Now these people are serving youth and children of the streets, who are involved in drugs, 
	  assaults, etc. In addition, some members of the church, who were former prisoners, go to the jails to preach and share 
	  their witness, telling of new life, new relationships, and feeling like a new person.</p>
	  
	  <p>Trying to reduce the violence among children and youth, the Church began a project in 2008 against buying violent 
	  toys for children. This year the campaign ran from November 1- 20, 2010. The church held workshops in Public Elementary 
	  Schools, Private Schools, Libraries, and urban public parks. Members and teachers shared peace teachings, taught about 
	  conflict resolution, acted out dramas, and taught how to make toys with imagination and things that might be thrown away.</p>
	  
	  <p>The campaign worked in 4 counties of the island. The goal was to reach 12 schools in each county (4 state public schools, 
	  4 national public national schools and 4 private schools), plus the Public Library Network. The campaign reached a total of 
	  36 schools, 80 teachers, and hundreds children. Several workshops were shown on Venezuelan Public Television with teachers 
	  and students participating. Nine local radio stations daily informed the public about the campaign. Seven articles or 
	  interviews were published by local newspapers. The closing of the Campaign was celebrated in the Central Public Park from 
	  8am to 4pm, and each school showed off their "recycled" and no-violent toys and offered them to people and families 
	  attending.</p>
	  
	  <p>Next year the Department of Education of the State of "Nueva Esparta" on Margarita Island wants to reach all Elementary 
	  Public Schools in that county with the same campaign.</p>
	  
	  <p>Two international non-profits helped with this champaign: "The Teaching Non-Violence Association" (Spain) and EPIC 
	  (US).</p>
