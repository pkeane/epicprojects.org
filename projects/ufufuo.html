	<p>Interfaith and international volunteers helping recover and rebuild following disasters including human caused disasters such as the burning of houses 
	of worship

<p>Using Quaker workcamping as a model, Ufufuo recruits and engages volunteers from  international and interfaith backgrounds to work together to effect spiritual 
recovery and rebuild communities damaged by natural or human caused disasters. The name "Ufufuo" is a Swahili word meaning rebirth and recovery. In rebuilding after 
war, arson or other tragedy, Ufufuo volunteers assert faith in vigorous activity to met human needs, rebuild what has been destroyed, and restore God's family as 
family.<p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Ufufuo evolved out of Quaker and interfaith volunteer workcamps in order to respond to the arson burning of houses of worship in the United States starting in 
1995 and continuing today. The early burnings were primarily of African American churches, but Moslem mosques are now increasingly being burned, or Hindu and 
Sikh temples that are mistaken for mosques! To date there have been over 1,600 burned houses of worship in America since 1995.</p>

<p>"Ufufuo" is a Swahili word that was chosen because it encompasses a variety of concepts including recovery and rebuilding. It can also imply resurrection, 
reconciliation and the rebirth is a part of God and nature's way of recovery after the winter in temperate zones and after the dry season in the tropics.</p>
 
<p>Human disasters such as war and arson mirror the natural disasters of hurricanes, fires and floods and are just as needful for recovery and reconciliation to 
enable the rebirth of hope and peace. Ufufuo volunteers are robust rebuilders, bringing hope and love by replacing destroyed structures. UFUFUO workcamps also 
provide an example of groups of very diverse persons working together peacefully to build God's human family as one people.</p>
